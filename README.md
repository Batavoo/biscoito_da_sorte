# ðŸ’» About the project

In this project, I created a game called "Fortune cookie", in which the user
*after pressing click or enter*, will open the cookie with it's fortune of the day.

While doing this challenge I used things like :
- Arrays
- HTML data structure
- CSS animations
- Javascript functions
- DOM manipulation
- Callback functions
